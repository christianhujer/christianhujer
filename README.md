### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm 🧙🏻‍♂️Christian Hujer, a passionate software crafter from 🇩🇪Germany living in 🌴Goa, 🇮🇳India.
Together with [Siddhesh Nikude](https://github.com/sidnik007), I'm the founder and CEO of [Nelkinda Software Craft](https://github.com/nelkinda).
At Nelkinda, we raise the bar of professional software development by doing it and showing others how to do it.

- 🦮 I'm helping teams and organizations (ranging from small 1-person startups to large international banks) to become more agile in their software development and business process.
- 🦮 I'm helping teams to migrate from Java to Kotlin.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to scale a business.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on making ensemble programming (fka mob programming) more popular.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with many things, see [Career at Nelkinda](https://nelkinda.com/career/).
- 💬 Ask me about anything.
